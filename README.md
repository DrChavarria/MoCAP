Hello and thank you for checking out my modular and cone-and-plate (MoCAP) device!
I have created this Github repository so other researchers may download and use the MoCAP mechanofluidic device for their own research. 
I have uploaded all the necessary hardware files that need to be 3D printed to assemble a functioning MoCAP device. 
I recommend checking out my manuscript to become acquainted with the MoCAP device.
I wish you the best on your mechanobioly assays and thank you for using the MoCAP device!

Sincerely, 
Dr. Daniel Chavarria
